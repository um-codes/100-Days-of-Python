In Python, the `print()` statement is used to display output to the console or terminal. It takes one or more arguments, which can be of any data type, and prints them to the standard output. Here's a basic example:

```Python
print("Hello, world!")
```

This would output "Hello, world!" to the console.

You can also print multiple values by separating them with commas:

```Python
name = "John" 
age = 30 
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)
```

This would output "Name: John Age: 30" to the console.

In Python 3.x, `print()` is a function, so it requires parentheses around its arguments, whereas in Python 2.x, it was a statement and didn't require parentheses.
